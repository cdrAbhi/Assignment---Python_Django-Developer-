Logic Notes for mthod-2
====================================

1. Purpose:  
===========
- Evaluate a list of binary strings to determine if they contain a "dangerous position" — defined as 7 consecutive `0`s or 7 consecutive `1`s.

---

2. Input:  
===============
   - A list `inputs` containing binary strings.

---

3. Output: 
=============== 
   - A list `result` where each entry is `"Yes"` or `"No"`, indicating whether the corresponding binary string contains a "dangerous position."

---

4. Logic:
===============
   - Case 1: Strings shorter than 7 characters:
     - Return `"No"` because they cannot contain 7 consecutive identical digits.
   - Case 2: Strings exactly 7 characters:
     - Check if the string equals `"0000000"` or `"1111111"`.
     - Append `"Yes"` if true, otherwise `"No"`.
   - Case 3: Strings longer than 7 characters:
     - Loop through the string and check for a sequence of 7 consecutive identical digits.
     - Use a counter (`c`) to track the length of consecutive identical digits.
     - If `c == 7` at any point, append `"Yes"` and stop further checks for that string.
     - If no sequence of 7 consecutive identical digits is found, append `"No"`.

---

5. Steps:
==============
   - Initialize an empty list `result`.
   - Iterate over each binary string in `inputs`:
     - For strings with a length less than 7, append `"No"`.
     - For strings with a length equal to 7, check if they are `"0000000"` or `"1111111"`. Append `"Yes"` or `"No"` accordingly.
     - For strings longer than 7, use a sliding check:
       - If a substring of 7 consecutive identical digits is found, append `"Yes"` and break the loop.
       - Otherwise, append `"No"` after the loop.

---

6. Edge Cases:
==================
   - Empty strings → Return `"No"`.
   - Strings shorter than 7 → Return `"No"`.
   - Strings exactly 7 characters → Direct match with `"0000000"` or `"1111111"`.
   - Strings longer than 7 → Check substrings for 7 consecutive identical digits.

---

7. Output Example:
======================
- For the provided input, the output is a print result for each input on new lines
Eg.
YES
NO
YES
YES
